  <section id="About">
    <p> My name is Mac, I'm a self taught developer from the North East of England. My adult life started out by going and dropping out of uni,
       finding the courses that I thought would be my passion, wasn't something I want to do as a career. The jobs I did afterwards helped me realise the things that I'd love in an ideal career.
       I set out on this journey to learn all I can and started a course to become a full stack developer, that course has brought me to here, making my own github.</p>
